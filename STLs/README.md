# &#x2B22; Printing Guide &#x2B22; 

Below you'll find information on recommended print settings, how to slice MMU parts, etc.

## Recommended Print Settings
All printed parts where possible are designed with the following print settings in mind.

> Material: `ABS/ASA` (_Or Better_)
>
> Perimeters: `4`
>
> Top/Bottom Layers: `5`
> 
> Infill: `40% Cubic`
> 
> Layer Height: `0.2mm` (_Incl. First Layer_)
> 
> Extrusion Width: `0.4mm Forced` (_Just For Internal/External Perimeters_)

<br>

## Optional Multi-Material Parts
Where applicable, there are `.step` files for parts that can be printed in multiple colours. They are often located in a folder of the part name along with an `.stl` of the part.

> After importing them into your slicer of choice, if they don't already show as multiple parts, right click on the object and split it into parts (not objects!).
