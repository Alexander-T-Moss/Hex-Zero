The original MatanRay mounts are extended. <br>
This prevents when lifting the sheet from the magnetic bed, that not the whole MantaRay frame is lifted. <br>
It doesn't prevent the bed to fall of the MantaRay mounts, when the printer is up-side-down. <br>
It limits it until a specific angle, after that, the bed still falls out of the mount. <br>

Need for this mod: <br>
6x 18mm pins with M3 thread <br>
