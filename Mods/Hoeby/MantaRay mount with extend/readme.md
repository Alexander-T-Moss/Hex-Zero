The original MatanRay mounts are extended.
This prevents when lifting the sheet from the magnetic bed, that not the whole MantaRay frame is lifted.
It doesn't prevent the bed to fall of the MantaRay mounts, when the printer is up-side-down. 
It limits it until a specific angle, after that, the bed still falls out of the mount

Need for this mod:
6x 18mm pins with M3 thread
