Mods specially for the AntHead, to get it fit to the HexZero.
By default, the AntHead has to probe on the back, that isn't going to work on the HexZero.
Therefor, the left duct is changed, to add zeroclick.

Only the changed parts can be downloaded. For all other parts, see the AntHead github
https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/AntHead

What are the changes:
- Left ducting
- Main body O2 with HX0 logo
- Main body sherpa with HX0 logo
- Led diffuser HX0 logo
- Led light shield HX0 logo
- ZeroClick dock for HX0

Optional
- Carriage mount
