<p align="center"><img width="500" src="Assets/HX0_AntHead.png"></p>

# Mod Guide
Mods specially for the AntHead, to get it fit to the HexZero. <br>
By default, the AntHead has to probe on the back, that isn't going to work on the HexZero. <br>
Therefor, the left duct is changed, to add zeroclick.

## Where to find the missing parts?
Only the changed parts can be downloaded. For all other parts, see the AntHead github. <br>
