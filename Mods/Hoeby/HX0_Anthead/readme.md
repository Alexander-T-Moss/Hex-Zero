<p align="center"><img width="750" src="Assets/HX0_AntHead.png"></p>

# Mod Guide
Mods specially for the AntHead, to get it fit to the HexZero. <br>
By default, the AntHead has to probe on the back, that isn't going to work on the HexZero. <br>
Therefor, the left duct is changed, to add zeroclick. <br>
The mod is drawn on AntHead version 43. <br>

Be carefull with mounting the led parts. <br>
Because of the logo, the parts are thin and fragile
