# Front belt blocks for HexZero
<p align="center"><img width="450" src="assets/image.png"></p>

## The idea for the mod
I made a mod for the front belt blocks. <br>
On my assembly i run into issues, when tension the front belts, that the tension force was bigger then de clamping force. <br>
The result was, that the belts jump out of the original blocks. 

## Which 3d parts are shared
Only the 3D printed parts for the PurgeBucket are shared. <br>
The bed-mount is mantaray and hammerhead bed compatible.

## Hardware needed for this mode
- 2x M2 nut
- 2x M2x25 or M2x30 (depends which version you print)

## Details about the version
When you take the version for the M2x25 screws, then the screws will drop deeper inside the rail block. <br>
If you want the screws flush with the top. Then there is a version for M2x30 screws. These screws will stick out by 2mm on the underside. <br>
But this should be no problem, because the cutouts in the bottom plate are big enough that the screws will drop in these cutouts. <br>
