# HexMetal
Toolhead carriage designed for SLM printing and use in the Hex Zero printer for ants or any other front-facing MGN9H rail printer.

This is heavily based on the **incredible** work Alex has done designing the Hex Zero.

~~Currently awaiting the first prototype by PCBWay :)~~
~~Received, belt path needs to be widened but all else is OK. New ETA: When I receive and test new part :)~~

Revised version received and test fitted. Minor tweaks made based on use.
Files have now been uploaded. **Highly advised** that you print in FDM first and consider how SLM tolerances would change the fit you get.

I have uploaded version with both a mounting for normal Dragonburner (and similar) as well as Alex's Dragonburner for Hex Zero.

This render is not fully indicative of the STLs, will update soon.
