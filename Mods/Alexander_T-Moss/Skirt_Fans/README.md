## Inspiration For These Panels
These panels are heavily inspired by Zen3D's [panels](https://mods.vorondesign.com/details/60h8bgimcM9twGxLT61EQ), however have been drawn up from scratch for better symettery, no CAD rounding issues along with several other CAD fixes. The side panel idea comes from Akio's [side panels](https://www.printables.com/model/788366-hex-pattern-electronics-compartment-side-covers-pl). Thank you to both for creating simply awesome printable panels!
