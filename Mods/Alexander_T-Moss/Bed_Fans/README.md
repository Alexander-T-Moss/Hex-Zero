# &#x2B22; Bed Fans &#x2B22;
Mounts for 3010 blower fans on the underside of the bed

## Tip For Wiring
You may have two spare wago's on the bed `centre_brace` that could be used for wiring the fans together, and then to the printer in a quickly detachable way

Mount on the top-most frame extrusions and double as side panel retaining clips (_replacing the mid clip that's originally there_). You will need to pre-load an additional M3 Hexnut if you can't use LDO drop-in nuts, to be able to install the handles!
