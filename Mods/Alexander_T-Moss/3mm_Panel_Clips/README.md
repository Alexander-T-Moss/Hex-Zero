# &#x2B22; 3mm Panel Clips &#x2B22; 

These are modified panel clips from the standard HX0 clips to allow using 3mm foam tape instead of 2mm foam tape. Please note you **cannot mix and match 3mm and 2mm panel clips!!**

All the 3mm clips have `3mm` appended to the end of their name compared to the stock clip to indicate what clips you replace with the 3mm variants

3mm clips use the same mounting bolts as the 2mm clips and there is no difference in hardware required (_except 3mm instead of 2mm foam_) needed for these clips
