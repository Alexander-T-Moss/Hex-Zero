# &#x2B22; Handles &#x2B22;
Simple handles to give somewhere to grab onto for lifting the printer up

## Note About Print Strength
You need to have good inter-layer adhesion in the print of these handles to make sure they don't crack or worse case snap... I recommend printing slightly hotter than you usually would and using a good quality filament (especially not any that have additives in to make the filament print matt)

## Where To Install
Mount on the top-most frame extrusions and double as side panel retaining clips (_replacing the mid clip that's originally there_). You will need to pre-load an additional M3 Hexnut if you can't use LDO drop-in nuts, to be able to install the handles!

## Required Hardware
| Name | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| M3x12 BHCS | 4x |
| M3 Hexnut | 2x* |

_*You reuse 2x M3 Hexnuts from the mid-panel clips that are where the handles are replacing, hence the mismatch in bolts and nut quantity for the handles_
