# Dual 4010 Axial Bed Fan Mount for Hex Zero

## About this mod
This replace's the mod Alexander made, allowing for even more CFM for chamber heating. <br>
It definitely works with the Hammerhead bed. I have not tested it on the Manta Ray but it probably works there too. <br>
I use GDStimes, I will update with the lifespan of those. <br>
Consider usinga stronger bed heater. The BOM 60w heater will definitely be overcooled by this. I use a 120w heater.

## Filament
I reccomend using you highest temp filament for this. <br>

## Hardware needed for this mode
- 2x M3x8
- 8x M3x12
- 8x M3 Heatset Inserts
