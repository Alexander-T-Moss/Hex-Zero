# Hex-Zero

At it's core, HX0 is a re-design of the [Tri-Zero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/tri-zero) Z motion, with a revised [Pandora Gantry](https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora). Without the aforementioned, non of this project would've been possible, so a great amount of thanks is due for [zruncho3d](https://github.com/zruncho3d) and [MasturMynd](https://github.com/MasturMynd) whom ultimtely sent me down this rabbit hole!

## What Differentiates Hex-Zero From Tri-Zero + Pandora Gantry?

1. *Optional* use of **M3 pins** in all possible bearing stacks (and the option to not use pins at all)
2. Use of **KGLM-03** spherical bearings in the flying bed Z joints
3. **Reduced Z height of the Z motor mounts** and skirts 
4. **New front Z tensioners/idlers** to allow clearance with MiniSB (*with additional travel of pandora gantry*)
5. All printed parts optimized to be **easier to print**
6. **More hexagons!**
