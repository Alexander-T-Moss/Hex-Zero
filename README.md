# Hex-Zero

Complete re-design of Tri-Zero, with a revised pandora gantry plus plenty of hexagons!

This projected all stemmed from wanting a boop on my V0, to now being a test platform for a future probe related project... top sekrit for now ;)

Hex-Zero sits between a scratch build and conversion as although it uses the original V0 frame (with the optional additon of one extra extrusion) it also requires a complete printer rebuild!

## Why Hex-Zero Over Tri-Zero + Pandora Gantry?

There are several major changes, besides aesthetics I've listed below:

1. Use of **KGLM-03** spherical bearings in the flying bed Z joints
2. **Reduced** the **Z height of the Z motor mounts** and skirts
3. **New front Z tensioners/idlers** to allow clearance with MiniSB

There are also these main tweaks to the pandora gantry:

1. **Uses M3 pins** instead of bolts on all bearing stacks (except the bearings in the front XY idlers that are also structural)
2. Redesigned all parts to print easier, **stronger** and match the rest of the aesthetic of Hex-Zero

At this point, **every** printed part has either been modified in some way, or completely redesigned/replaced from Tri-Zero/Pandora Gantry 

## So You Want To Build A Hex-Zero?

**DISCLAIMER: First and foremost, I cannot emphasise enough that this project is in the very early stages of testing! There is a fairly high likely hood of issues that you may uncover I've missed. I'll work to fix these issues as soon as I have the time to but now that disclamer is over, lets begin!**

### What Do I Need To Buy?

The bill of materials for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7fQtRNNPEZ1YoKCzFcIuKrkByZ1SoN8qf_lLwIh3ww/edit?usp=sharing) :) I have double, triple, quadruple checked the quantaties of fasteners, but as always, to be on the safe side, I strongly recommend you buy extra! (You may also find it worth while to pick up some bolts where you'd only have a few left over if using the ones on your V0.2 already, indicated by the small grey'd out negative numbers) **If you notice any issues with the BOM, please let me know ASAP!**

There are two BOM sheets, one for if you're converting a V0.2 --> Hex-Zero and a "*Full*" Hex-Zero BOM. You'll most likely want to be referencing the V0.2 --> Hex-Zero BOM :)

### Assembly Instructions?

This is the current focus of my time, creating a Voron quality level manual, for this project. Once it gets into a partially finished state (or atleast the first few sections), a link to it can be found here, but until then you'll need to use the CAD model and the rough order of operations bellow:

1.  Todo: Make a rough order of operations...
