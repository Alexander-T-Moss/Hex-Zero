If you have stumbled across this by chance, all files here are pre-release and potentially not tested, please keep in mind the files will change regularly as issues are found and resolved through testing. Happy printing :)

Bellow is a list of things that still need to be done before considering public release:

- [ ] Create _more_ electronics mounts
- [ ] Adjust panel clips to utilise foam tape and clear XY joints - _started working on this_
- [ ] Create some sort of proper feet
- [ ] Finish tidying up the CAD
- [ ] Create a minimalistic BOM (on a budget BOM)
- [x] Create display mount
- [ ] Design a printable deck panel (and possibly other panels)
- [ ] Create wire mangement stuff
- [ ] Add pins to AB drives
- [ ] Create new rear z belt mount
- [ ] Improve MiniSB nozzle LED mounting
- [ ] Add cool hexagon patterns to panels, idk if I'll actually do this, probably will do it if I'm procrastinating from studying
- [ ] Design rear panel to be a door for easier/tool-less access to electronics at the rear

## Change Log:

**25/04/2023** - Changed `centre_brace` for better clearance, and also changed the M4/GE4C gantry attachments. Note: I think I'll need to fix the issues that the M4/GE4C gantry attachments had for the M3/KGLM-03 but haven't gotten around to this!

**20/04/2023** - Changed `[a]_x_carriage` for better belt fitting and `rear_z_nema_17_motor_mount` to attach easier. Also added mounting for V0 Display
