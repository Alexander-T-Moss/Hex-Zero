# &#x2B22; Hex-Zero &#x2B22; 

At its core, HX0 is a re-design of the [Tri-Zero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/tri-zero) Z motion, with a revised [Pandora Gantry](https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora). Without the aforementioned, none of this project would've been possible, so a great amount of thanks is due to [zruncho3d](https://github.com/zruncho3d) and [MasturMynd](https://github.com/MasturMynd) whom indirectly sent me down this rabbit hole!

## What Differentiates Hex-Zero From Tri-Zero + Pandora Gantry?

When I started working on Hex-Zero, I wanted to address my main concern with Tri-Zero, which was the robustness of the flying bed. I also liked the more honeycomb look of the V0.2 skirts and wanted to incorporate that style into the Hex-Zero skirts. I also noticed some other compatibility issues with how I intended to build thingsÂ so would need to address them. Below is a summary of some of the major tweaks and changes you'll notice when comparing Hex-Zero to Tri-Zero + Pandora Gantry.

1. Option to either **use bolts** on all bearing stacks **or pins** on all bearing stacks
2. Use **KGLM-03** spherical bearings in the flying bed Z joints (_improve rigidity_)
3. **Reduced Z height of the Z motor mounts** and skirts (_part of the aesthetic changes_)
4. **New front Z tensioners/idlers** to allow clearance with MiniSB (*with additional travel of pandora style gantry*)
5. Optimize printed parts to be **easier to print**
6. **More best-agon hexagons!**

Documentation is another frequently overlooked aspect of projects like these (and by far the most time-consuming thing to complete). When I first started this journey (_before even designing anything_), I had many questions about hardware compatibility, such as "If I do thing A, can I also do thing B", "To do thing C, what do I need for thing D" and "Will doing thing E even work!" To make this project as accessible as possible, I intend to develop documentation and resources that address as many common questions as possible!



## Community Beta Testing Builds

I want to extend a massive thanks to everyone who took a leap of faith in building and testing this project in its early stages, below is a collage of some HX0s built during the beta testing of this project :)
