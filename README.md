# Hex-Zero

Complete re-design of Tri-Zero, with a revised pandora gantry plus plenty of hexagons!

This projected all stemmed from wanting a boop on my V0, to now being a test platform for a future probe related project... top sekrit for now ;)

Hex-Zero sits between a scratch build and conversion as although it uses the original V0 frame (with the optional additon of one extra extrusion), it also requires a complete printer rebuild

## Why Hex-Zero Over Tri-Zero?

There are several major changes, besides aesthetics I've listed below:

1. Use of **KGLM-03** spherical bearings in the flying bed z joints
2. **Reduced** the **Z height of the Z motor mounts** and skirts
3. **New front Z tensioners/idlers** to allow clearance with MiniSB

There are also these mani tweaks to the pandora gantry:

1. **Uses M3 pins** instead of bolts on all bearing stacks (except the bearings in the front XY idlers that are also structural)
2. Redesigned all parts to print easier, **stronger** and match the aesthetic of hex-zero

At this point, **every** printed part has either been modified in some way, or completely redesigned/replaced from Tri-Zero/Pandora Gantry

**If you have stumbled across this by chance, all files here are in the early stages of beta and potentially not tested, please keep in mind the files WILL CHANGE regularly as issues are found and resolved through testing. Happy printing :)**
