If you have stumbled across this by chance, all files here are pre-release and potentially not tested, please keep in mind the files will change regularly as issues are found and resolved through testing. Happy printing :)

Bellow is a list of things that still need to be done before considering public release:

- [ ] Create _more_ electronics mounts
- [ ] Adjust panel clips to utilise foam tape and clear XY joints
- [ ] Create some sort of proper feet
- [ ] Finish tidying up the CAD
- [ ] Create a minimalistic BOM (on a budget BOM)
- [ ] Create display mounts
- [ ] Design a printable deck panel (and possibly other panels)

Current Printer Travel:

## Change Log:
