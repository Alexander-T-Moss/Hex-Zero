# Hex-Zero

At it's core, HX0 is a re-design of the [Tri-Zero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/tri-zero) Z motion, with a revised [Pandora Gantry](https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora). Without the aforementioned, non of this project would've been possible, so a great amount of thanks is due for [zruncho3d](https://github.com/zruncho3d) and [MasturMynd](https://github.com/MasturMynd) whom ultimtely sent me down this rabbit hole!

## What Differentiates Hex-Zero From Tri-Zero + Pandora Gantry?

These are several of the major differentiating features of HX0:

1. *Optional* use of **M3 pins** in all possible bearing stacks (and the option to not use pins at all)
2. Use of **KGLM-03** spherical bearings in the flying bed Z joints
3. **Reduced Z height of the Z motor mounts** and skirts 
4. **New front Z tensioners/idlers** to allow clearance with MiniSB (*with additional travel of pandora gantry*)
5. All printed parts optimized to be **easier to print**
6. **More hexagons!**



## So You Want To Build A Hex-Zero?

The bill of materials to convert a V0.2 to a HX0 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7fQtRNNPEZ1YoKCzFcIuKrkByZ1SoN8qf_lLwIh3ww/edit?usp=sharing). Then with everything you need ordered, you can get cracking printing the [STLs](https://github.com/Alexander-T-Moss/Hex-Zero/tree/main/STLs). For the time being you will need to use the CAD as reference when building your HX0, but a detailed instruction manual is being created to be released at a later date!



## Toolheads & Probes

Any probe and toolhead combination that works with Tri-Zero should work on Hex-Zero, and with the extra XY movement freedom from the pandora style gantry, it allows more flexibility of placing probe docks. I did also create a simple mini klicky style probe for HX0 w/ MiniSB you can find <u>here</u>(link to mini klicky repo)



## Community Pre-Release Builds

I want to extend a massive thanks to everyone that took a leap of faith building and testing this project in it's early stages, below is a collage of some HX0's built during the beta testing of this project :)
