# Hex-Zero
The amalgomation of Tri-Zero, Pandora, V0.2 and plenty of extra hexagons!

If you have stumbled across this by chance, all files here are pre-release and potentially not tested, please keep in mind the files will change regularly as issues are found and resolved through testing. Happy printing :)

Bellow is a list of things that still need to be done before considering public release:

1. Create _more_ electronics mounts
2. Adjust panel clips to utilise foam tape and clear XY joints
3. Create some sort of proper feet
4. Finish tidying up the CAD
