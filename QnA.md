## How Much Does It Cost To Convert My V0 To A HX0
Approximately **£100/$125/€115** to **£150/$190/€175**. You may be wondering why there is such a wide range. The cost is entirely dependent on what you already have and how Gucci you want to be when purchasing parts, but you can convert a V0 to a HX0 for somewhere in this range (_conservative estimate_), if not less!

## Do I Need To Buy Extra Extrusion?
Technically, no, but I dislike wording things like that, so allow me to explain. 

If you have a V0 with an extrusion bed, you can build the flying bed using the stock V0 bed extrusions and a printed placeholder at the back of the printer. However, LDO has begun shipping kits with a kirigami and no bed extrusions, which means you will need to source at least one 100mm and one 200mm (or just three 100mm) extrusions for the flying bed in this case, as well as an additional 200mm extrusion for the printer's rear or use the printed place holder.

All that being said, the stock V0 extrusion bed is made up of three 100mm extrusions, and ideally, you want to use a single 200mm instead of two 100mm on the front of the flying bed, so you may still need to source 200mm extrusions for the flying bed and while you're at it, get one for the back of the printer. I should also clarify that the additional rear extrusion is not structural and is only there to make mounting skirts easier at the back of the printer!

Fortunately, these additional extrusions are in lengths that can typically be found pre-cut and tapped

## Do I Need To Drill Holes In The Existing V0 Extrusions
If you want to mount the rear extrusion, drill two holes to accommodate it. With the printed placeholder, however, you can avoid drilling holes, but I strongly advise you to drill the necessary holes.

There is a jig included to drill the holes, making it rather simple, and because these holes are only to allow an Allen key through to tighten a blind joint bolt, they do not need to be accurate, so there is no need to go for sub-mm or anything silly precise with them!

## Can I Serial A HX0 As a V0?
**Yes**. HX0s can be serialised as a V0 (_assuming you are not converting an existing serialised V0_) while also receiving a HX0 serial to display on the printer!

## What Probe Should I Use?
- Need to write about this in a separate readme, and will link to it here when complete
