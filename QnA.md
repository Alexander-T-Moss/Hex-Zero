## Common Questions And Answers

### Can I serial a HX0 as a V0?
**Yes**. HX0's can be serialised as a V0 _(assuming you are not converting an existing serialised V0_) and also get a HX0 serial to display on the printer!

### How Much Does It Cost To Convert My V0 To A HX0
Around **£100/$125/€115** to **£150/$190/€175**. Now you might be thinking why such a range? Well, the cost is entirely dependent on what you already have and how Gucci you want to be when buying parts, but you can convert a V0 to a HX0 somewhere in this region (_conservative estimate_) if not lower!

### Do I Need To Buy Extra Extrusion?
Technically no, but I dislike wording things like that so let me explain. 

If you have V0 with an extrusion bed, then you can build the flying bed with the stock V0 bed extrusions, and use a printed placeholder at the rear of the printer. However, LDO has started shipping kits with a kirigami and no bed extrusions, this means you will need to source at least 1x 100mm and 1x 200mm (or just 3x 100mm) extrusions for the flying bed in this case and either source an additional 200mm extrusion for the rear of the printer or use the printed place holder.

All this said it should be noted that the stock V0 extrusion bed consists of 3x 100mm extrusions and ideally you want to use a single 200mm instead of 2x 100mm on the front of the flying bed, so you still might want to source 200mm extrusions for the flying bed and the rear of the printer. I should also make clear that the additional rear extrusion isn't structural and is purely to make mounting skirts easier at the rear of the printer!

Fortunately, these additional extrusions are in lengths that can normally be found pre-cut and tapped

### Do I Need To Drill Holes In The Existing V0 Extrusions
If you want to mount the rear extrusion, then you need to drill 2 holes to accommodate this. With the printed placeholder though you can get away with not drilling holes, but I highly recommend you drill the needed holes.

There is an included jig to drill the holes making it rather easy, and as these holes are just to be able to get an Allen key through to tighten a blind joint bolt, they don't need to be accurate so there is no stress to get sub-mm or anything silly precision with them!
